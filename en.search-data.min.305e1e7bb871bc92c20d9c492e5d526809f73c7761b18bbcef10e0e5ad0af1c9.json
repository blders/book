One method that tends to work well for learning 3-style as a whole is to first look at a sheet (if you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out, Jack Cai\u0026rsquo;s sheet, or a slightly modified version is a great start) and go through each case one by one.\nThe pre-requisite for this is that you know and understand how commutators work.\nFor each case, first try and come up with a commutator (without looking at what the sheet has), then afterwards, look at what the sheet has and compare it with your own solution. Take what the sheet has into account and learn from it - apply it to the commutators you come up with in the future!\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/bigbld/content/5bld/","title":"5BLD","section":"BigBLD","content":".\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/execution/content/turning/","title":"Turning","section":"Execution","content":"One common misconception that people have when it comes to blindfolded turning is that the focus is increasing your turning speed and trying to turn as fast as possible, but this is pretty much untrue!\nIf you ever watch top 3x3 blindfolded solvers' solves, you might notice the fast turning, but that\u0026rsquo;s actually a product of (pretty much) not locking up and pausing. The important part of that sentence that you should strive for is the last part - if you\u0026rsquo;re not locking up and not pausing, you\u0026rsquo;ll have an easier time improving your turning. While there is still some aspect of turning speed, as long as you\u0026rsquo;re using somewhat reasonable fingertricks (regrip if you think the way you\u0026rsquo;re executing an alg leads to a somewhat weird fingertrick).\nIf you strive for not pausing or locking up, which basically means you\u0026rsquo;re transitioning between your comms fairly well, then you\u0026rsquo;ll have a better time with getting better at blindfolded turning.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/miscellaneous/content/floating/","title":"Floating","section":"Miscellaneous","content":".\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/memorization/content/accuracy/","title":"Accuracy","section":"Memorization","content":".\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/memorization/content/tracing/","title":"Tracing","section":"Memorization","content":".\n"}]
