If you ever watch top 3x3 blindfolded solvers' solves, you might notice the fast turning, but that&amp;rsquo;s actually a product of (pretty much) not locking up and pausing. The important part of that sentence that you should strive for is the last part - if you&amp;rsquo;re not locking up and not pausing, you&amp;rsquo;ll have an easier time improving your turning.</description></item></channel></rss>
